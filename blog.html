			<p> For Ex5, I chose to explore the script.aculo.us library. It appealed to me because I believed it would
			be useful for my final project, particularly the drag and drop feature, as well as the sortable list effect.
			In addition, there were many other effects that I wanted to check out, such as the shake, pulsate, or puff 
			that I implemented with some of the pictures. My main hurdle with this library is that it does not have 
			compatibility with jQuery, which is a huge disadvantage. I spent a long while trying to get them to work with each 
			other, until I realized with some online research that it was not an option. For this reason, I would not particularly 
			recommend this library to my peers, as jQuery is much more effective, dynamic, and can actually do many of the things 
			that script.aculo.us can.

			<p>This is my interface for my Pocket Full of Interface project. I connected the various visual 
			elements of my design by utilizing a common color scheme and the round button-like shape. I used a
			gradient in order to give my elements dimension. When hovered, the image changes in content and size,
			allowing the user to interact with it smoothly. I used the animate function to achieve this. Another
			effective aspect I think is the circle that the elements are arranged in. A third aspect is the click 
			function that pulls up an overlay that provides more information about the element that is being explored.

			<p>	This is my Time is On My Side. I was struggling with the functions, so it did not turn out exactly how I planned.
			I really did enjoy this project, but I just to give myself more time to figure out the technical aspects.
			I also spent a great deal of time trying to get my project to animate, even though it wasn't part of the requirements
			so I regret wasting that time instead of focusing on getting it to work. I want to add more features such as color code 
			the hour by using a span tag for each element. In addition, I want to add a click feature. However, I did learn a great 
			deal of jquery, which I find very fun! I see a lot of potential for my next project; I just have to start early and give myself lots of time to experiment.

			<p>	A web-based form I use often is the log-in screen for UC Davis web applications. 
			It features two input boxes, one for the Login ID, and one for the Passphrase. The layout is  
			friendly as it is clear where the input boxes are and they are clearly labelled. The type hierarchy 
			is working as it shows what the page is, with "Secure Log In" in the biggest font size. The Login ID 
			and Passphrase labels could be larger so that the user does not get confused with the other type that is
			the same size. The color scheme is professional and apt for a university, but it could use with a bit of 
			livening up. The various colors of the type work well to point out and distinguish the links from the 
			static type.

            <h3><span class=date>January 7, 2016</span></h3>
			<p>	An interface that I frequently use is the smartsite for UC Davis.
				An aspect of the design for the website interface that I found to 
				be quite effective is that the navigation is very clear. The menus 
				stay in the same place regardless of the page that is being visited,
				and this is appealing as it does not confuse the user. I also 
				appreciate the responsive design that makes the content quite fluid, 
				such as the top blue menu that expands down to fit the sections if 
				the browser is made smaller. The side menu changes content depending 
				on the class that has been selected at the top. Visually, I think 
				the type hierarchy is working well and each section has its own 
				space. I personally feel that the overall look could be made more 
				appealing with better color choices and shapes, and maybe even some 
				motion graphics. However, I think the current colors convey a 
				professional sense to the user, and the interface serves the 
				functional purpose of an organizational website for communication 
				between students and teachers.
