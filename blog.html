			<p>	An interface that I frequently use is the smartsite for UC Davis.
				An aspect of the design for the website interface that I found to 
				be quite effective is that the navigation is very clear. The menus 
				stay in the same place regardless of the page that is being visited,
				and this is appealing as it does not confuse the user. I also 
				appreciate the responsive design that makes the content quite fluid, 
				such as the top blue menu that expands down to fit the sections if 
				the browser is made smaller. The side menu changes content depending 
				on the class that has been selected at the top. Visually, I think 
				the type hierarchy is working well and each section has its own 
				space. I personally feel that the overall look could be made more 
				appealing with better color choices and shapes, and maybe even some 
				motion graphics. However, I think the current colors convey a 
				professional sense to the user, and the interface serves the 
				functional purpose of an organizational website for communication 
				between students and teachers.

			<p>	A web-based form I use often is the log-in screen for UC Davis web applications. 
			It features two input boxes, one for the Login ID, and one for the Passphrase. The layout is  
			friendly as it is clear where the input boxes are and they are clearly labelled. The type hierarchy 
			is working as it shows what the page is, with "Secure Log In" in the biggest font size. The Login ID 
			and Passphrase labels could be larger so that the user does not get confused with the other type that is
			the same size. The color scheme is professional and apt for a university, but it could use with a bit of 
			livening up. The various colors of the type work well to point out and distinguish the links from the 
			static type.
