			<h3>January 7, 2016</h3>
			<p>	An interface that I frequently use is the smartsite for UC Davis.
				An aspect of the design for the website interface that I found to 
				be quite effective is that the navigation is very clear. The menus 
				stay in the same place regardless of the page that is being visited,
				and this is appealing as it does not confuse the user. I also 
				appreciate the responsive design that makes the content quite fluid, 
				such as the top blue menu that expands down to fit the sections if 
				the browser is made smaller. The side menu changes content depending 
				on the class that has been selected at the top. Visually, I think 
				the type hierarchy is working well and each section has its own 
				space. I personally feel that the overall look could be made more 
				appealing with better color choices and shapes, and maybe even some 
				motion graphics. However, I think the current colors convey a 
				professional sense to the user, and the interface serves the 
				functional purpose of an organizational website for communication 
				between students and teachers.
